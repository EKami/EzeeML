This script implements a neural network to enhance images:
 - https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05927

Other interesting papers:
 - https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10319
 - https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/deep-image-prior

 Seems to be the best one in term of accuracy/speed:
  - https://github.com/phoenix104104/LapSRN (no hallucination)
  -> (letsenhance) https://github.com/LimBee/NTIRE2017
